# Compass Build Workflow Guide

This folder has five spec docs. Each one has a job.  
Follow this sequence when building:

---

## 1. Compass MVP Spec (v1.4.2)
- **Purpose:** Defines the scope of the MVP.  
- **When to use:** Before writing code or adding features.  
- **Rule:** If it’s not in here, don’t build it.  

---

## 2. Data Model / Domain Mapping
- **Purpose:** Blueprint of the data (tables, JSON, API fields).  
- **When to use:** Any time you touch database, fixtures, or backend APIs.  
- **Rule:** Don’t invent new fields; check here first.  

---

## 3. Bilingual Mapping
- **Purpose:** Special rules for two-language support.  
- **When to use:** Any code or schema that shows, stores, or exports bilingual content.  
- **Rule:** Don’t guess—use the mapping.  

---

## 4. Next Steps
- **Purpose:** Current action plan.  
- **When to use:** Day-to-day coding decisions.  
- **Rule:** Build in the order listed. Update this doc as things get done.  

---

## 5. Test Checklist
- **Purpose:** QA notebook. Tracks what to verify.  
- **When to use:** After coding a feature.  
- **Rule:** Add a line here every time you add or change a feature.

## Daily Flow
1. Open **Next Steps** → pick what to do today.  
2. Check **MVP Spec** → confirm it’s in scope.  
3. Check **Data Model** (and **Bilingual Mapping** if relevant).  
4. Build the feature.  
5. Update **Test Checklist** with how you’ll prove it works.

This way you always know:
- *What* to build (Spec)  
- *How* to shape the data (Model)  
- *Language rules* (Mapping)  
- *What’s next* (Next Steps)  
- *How to test it* (Checklist)
